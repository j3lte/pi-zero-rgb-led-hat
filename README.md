# Resin for RGB hat

This is a Resin image for the [WaveShare RGB LED HAT](http://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RGB_LED_HAT). It uses the original [RGB_LED_HAT](http://www.waveshare.com/wiki/File:RGB_LED_HAT.tar.gz) example code, but with some modifications (better page, brightness control, Bootstrap theme).

Basics: [rpi_ws281x library](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)

It will start a webserver that you can access through your public Resin URL. This page can be used to control your led hat.
